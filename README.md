# RadarBeetle

Vue 3 Sample Application for Retrieving and Rendering Radar Station Locations

## Quick Questions:

*You know the Composition API would make some of this easier, right? And it's so shiny and cool and abstractions and...*

I prefer the structure afforded by the options API and since this was an example project, I treated it like I would a hobby project, but I'm comfortable with either depending on the requirements of the project. 

*I found a bug!*

Fantastic, please let me know what it was! This was an example project and there is a laundry list of things that I would like to improve upon or that remain incomplete. I always welcome feedback!

*I can't get the content to populate from my local in my browser!*

Yep, you'll need a browser extension to support this locally as it isn't production ready!
